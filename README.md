Librarian Trainer App

UPDATE: New game called Find Call Numbers has been added for additional learning!

*** Introduction ***

In a library, finding the correct place for a book on the shelves requires librarians to be able to 
sort call numbers in numerical and then alphabetical order. The call number for the prescribed 
book for this module is 005.73 JAM – the numbers indicate the topic of the book, and the letters 
are the first three letters of the author’s surname.

Welcome to the Library App, a learning game/application designed to help new librarians practice essential skills 
needed in a library setting. This app provides a hands-on experience for sorting and 
ordering books based on call numbers, a fundamental task in library management.

*** How to Use The App ***
